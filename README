                                  ### MOOD ###

Simple CLI mood tracker

# FEATURES

* Log mood ratings. You can do multiple per day
* View mood history over the day, week, month, year, or full history
* Edit entries for previous days

# BUILDING

From this directory, `dub build` (you'll need dub and dmd installed).

# INSTALLATION

Build, then copy `mood` to somewhere in your $PATH

# FILES

Mood saves mood history to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mood-history` (if that variable isn't
set then it's under `~/.local/share/`). That's the only persistent file it'll
touch.
